## 📚 Technical Concepts & Fun Tips

## Technical Concepts & Fun Tips 🛠️✨
| Week | Concept | Explanation | Fun Tip |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Week 1** | OpenGL vs. DirectX | Graphics APIs; OpenGL is cross-platform, DirectX is Windows-focused. | Choose wisely, like picking your Pokémon starter! |
| | CPU vs. GPU | CPU handles logic, GPU handles rendering. | GPUs = artists, CPUs = managers. |
| | 2D vs. 3D | 2D = points on a plane, 3D = axes and depth. | 2D: Simpler but less immersive; 3D: Welcome to the Matrix. |
| **Week 2** | Material Application | Drag & drop textures onto objects or assign via Mesh Renderer. | Lazy devs love drag-and-drop! |
| | Light Pollution Control | Avoid over-lighting; use intensity & range wisely. | If you feel blinded, so will your players. |
| **Week 3** | Rigidbody | Enables Unity physics; responds to gravity, forces, collisions. | Feels like bringing a rock to life. |
| | Gravity Control | Customizable in Rigidbody settings. | Zero gravity? Floating chaos unlocked! |
| | OnCollision vs. OnTrigger | OnCollision includes physics response; OnTrigger is for logic. | Triggers = invisible switches! |
| **Week 4** | Character Controller | A specialized component for player movement. | Avoids reinventing the wheel for movement. |
| | SimpleMove vs. Move | SimpleMove includes time factor; Move doesn’t. | One does the math for you, one lets you suffer. |
| | Jumping Physics | Uses velocity + gravity for realistic movement. | Apply force upwards, let gravity do the rest. |
| | Heightmaps | Convert real-world elevation into Unity terrains. | Want to game in your backyard? Import its heightmap! |

## Debug Table 🐞🔍
| Bug | Observation | Solution | Funny Comment |
|------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Local vs Global confusion in rotations | Switch between modes with toolbar; always check if rotation happens relative to parent or world. | Always verify rotation frame of reference. | Unity gaslighting me into thinking I rotated wrong. |
| Overwhelmed by Unity panels | Too many buttons, too many views. | Took deep breaths and focused on one panel at a time. | "Where am I? What year is it?" |
| Static spheres not rolling | Two spheres sitting awkwardly on each other — zero rolling, 100% awkwardness. | Added colliders, adjusted rigid body parameters. | They're just shy. Let them roll into friendship! |
| Creepy character snapping | Character face suddenly flips toward camera — terrifying horror movie moment. | Used LookAt with normalized vector and world rotation settings. | Instant Exorcist mode: activated. |
| Sudden object tunneling | Falling spheres going through the plane, physics ignored. | Switched collision detection to Continuous, added interpolation. | When gravity says "goodbye" mid-fall. |
| Diagonal speed boost | Moving diagonally made the object run faster than Sonic. | Normalized input vector magnitude. | Mario Kart drift unlocked by accident. |
| Trigger confusion | Didn’t know which object the other was referring to in OnTriggerEnter(). | Clarified reference: slime = trigger holder; "other" = object entering zone. | "Other" was the friend we made along the way. |
| Infinite Jumping | Player could jump infinitely like Flappy Bird. | Added grounded check before allowing jumps. | Accidental infinite jetpack mode unlocked! |
| Ramp Gravity Snapping | Falling from a ramp caused unnatural snapping effect. | Adjusted gravity calculations and ensured smooth velocity transition. | When Unity physics takes "teleportation" a bit too seriously. |
