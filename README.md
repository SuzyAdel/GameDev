## Last Glass Catastrophe🔥💔

Made a vicious spike collider that ruthlessly destroys any ball daring to fall on it—until I figure out how to make them burst into glorious, dramatic explosions. Also generated a maze script… which, uh, kinda exists but isn't exactly *mazey* yet. Work in progress. 😅

## 📚 Technical Concepts & Fun Tips 🛠️✨

| Week | Concept | Explanation | Fun Tip |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Week 1** | OpenGL vs. DirectX | Graphics APIs; OpenGL is cross-platform, DirectX is Windows-focused. | Choose wisely, like picking your Pokémon starter! 🔥🌱💧 |
|  | CPU vs. GPU | CPU handles logic, GPU handles rendering. | GPUs = artists, CPUs = managers. 🎨🧠 |
|  | 2D vs. 3D | 2D = points on a plane, 3D = axes and depth. | 2D: Simpler but less immersive; 3D: Welcome to the Matrix. 🕶️ |
| **Week 2** | Material Application | Drag & drop textures onto objects or assign via Mesh Renderer. | Lazy devs love drag-and-drop! 🐌🖱️ |
|  | Light Pollution Control | Avoid over-lighting; use intensity & range wisely. | If you feel blinded, so will your players. 😎💡 |
| **Week 3** | Rigidbody | Enables Unity physics; responds to gravity, forces, collisions. | Feels like bringing a rock to life. 🪨✨ |
|  | Gravity Control | Customizable in Rigidbody settings. | Zero gravity? Floating chaos unlocked! 🛸 |
|  | OnCollision vs. OnTrigger | OnCollision includes physics response; OnTrigger is for logic. | Triggers = invisible switches! 🚪✨ |
| **Week 4** | Character Controller | A specialized component for player movement. | Avoids reinventing the wheel for movement. 🛞🕹️ |
|  | SimpleMove vs. Move | SimpleMove includes time factor; Move doesn’t. | One does the math for you, one lets you suffer. 🧮😩 |
|  | Jumping Physics | Uses velocity + gravity for realistic movement. | Apply force upwards, let gravity do the rest. 🪂 |
|  | Heightmaps | Convert real-world elevation into Unity terrains. | Want to game in your backyard? Import its heightmap! 🏡🗺️ |
| **Week 5** | URP vs. Built-in Rendering | Learned to compare URP (Universal Rendering Pipeline) and Built-in rendering systems, and when to use each in a project. | Choose URP for high-quality visuals on newer hardware! 📸 |
|  | Terrain Sculpting & Layers | We manually sculpted the terrain and learned how to assemble layers through both code and mouse interaction. | Sculpt like a pro! Click Ctrl to reverse your terrain sculpting action. 🪄 |
|  | Wind Effects on Terrain & Trees | Learned to link wind with terrain details such as grass, leaves, and trees, and apply wind settings to these elements. | Make your trees sway! Add randomness to your wind to create more natural movement. 🌬️🌳 |
|  | Heightmaps | Explored creating terrains from heightmaps, adjusting resolution, and understanding scaling and elevation. | Heightmaps are like topographic art! Make sure your map’s dimensions are 2ⁿ+1. 📏🖼️ |
|  | Tree Placement | Worked on adding trees, applying colliders, and randomizing tree size for a more realistic look. | Don’t mess with tree scale in the transform settings! Adjust it in the import settings for best results. 🌲📐 |
|  | Raycasting | Explored Raycasting to view exact hit points in terrain, helpful for precise placement or collision detection. | Raycast to perfection! It’s like having X-ray vision for your game world. 🔦🎯 |
| **Week 6** | Torque vs. Force | Torque causes rotation, force causes translation. Used torque for spherical movement. | Torque = spin to win! Great for rolling characters. 🔄⚙️ |
|  | Shield Restoration | Shard collection triggers shield restoration using UI fill bars and timers. | Shields up! Gamify it with visuals for dramatic effect. 🛡️✨ |
|  | Tag vs. Layer | Tags help identify objects; layers are for grouping in rendering and physics. | Tags = name badges; Layers = VIP access groups. 🎟️📚 |
|  | LayerMask Filtering | Used in raycasting to detect only specific object types. | Raycast smarter, not harder. LayerMask your way to clarity. 🧠🔍 |
|  | Coroutine Timing | Used coroutine to spawn shards every 5 seconds with delay logic. | Time-based spawning? Coroutine is your bestie! ⏲️💙 |
|  | Event Triggers | Triggered audio, particles, and animations on shard collection. | Make interactions magical with sparkles and sounds! ✨🔊💫 |
| **Week 7** | Fire Particle Systems | Fire is created using Unity's Particle System. Parameters like lifetime, speed, emission rate, shape, and color over time simulate realistic fire. | If your fire looks like sad orange dots, tweak the alpha over lifetime curve — trust the process 🔥📈 |
| | Fire Prefab Setup | Fire effects are usually built as prefabs combining particle systems, lights, sound, and sometimes colliders (for damage or detection). | Bundle that flame! Think of it like a spicy sandwich — particles, glow, sound = 🔥 combo 🌯 |
| | Optimization Tips | Keep the particle count low, use GPU Instancing, and limit the update rate to save performance. | Fire’s cool until it burns your frame rate. Keep it classy, not laggy. 💻🔥 |
| **Week 8** | Animator Controller | The Animator controls transitions between animation states using a state machine (Idle → Walk → Jump, etc.). | The Animator is like a DJ: cueing up the next move based on the vibe. 🕺🎧 |
|  | Parameters & Transitions | Parameters (bool, float, int, trigger) control transitions. You set them in script with `animator.SetTrigger("Jump")`, etc. | Set it, don’t forget it — a missing trigger is how silent movies happen in Unity. 🎬😶 |
|  | Root Motion vs. Scripted | Root Motion uses animation data to move the character; Scripted uses Rigidbody or Transform. Choose based on control needs. | Root Motion = autopilot ✈️. Scripted = manual drive 🕹️. Know when to chill, and when to steer. |

| **Week 7**| Fire particle flickering too fast | Flames looked like they were panicking 💥 | Adjusted particle lifetime and added slight delay between bursts | The fire had more anxiety than me during finals 🔥😅 |
|  **Week 8**| Animation snapping between idle/walk | Jerky blend when speed was near zero | Smoothed the parameter threshold + added damping | My character’s dance moves were not it 💃🪩 |
|  | Character floating during jump animation | Jump clip had root motion enabled | Disabled root motion for vertical transitions | Moonwalking in the air like it’s 2099 🚀🌕 |
|  |Timeline didn’t trigger animation | Bound objects weren’t set in PlayableDirector | Manually dragged GameObject into track binding | Unity really said “do it yourself” 🧱👷 |

## 🌌 Game Story

*A magical sphere must climb a dangerous mountain to reach the Summit Portal, a mysterious gateway at the peak. But the journey is not easy, as huge rocks fall from above, threatening to break its protective blue shield.*

*To survive, the sphere must dodge falling rocks while collecting blue shards, which restore lost parts of its shield. Every hit from a rock weakens the shield, making the climb even riskier.*

*Can the sphere overcome the mountain's challenges and complete its journey?*

## 💡 Beyond the Basics
✅ Sound effects for rain falling  
✅ Sound effects for rock impact and shard pickup  
✅ Simple UI with health/shield bar and shard count
