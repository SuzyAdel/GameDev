## Last Glass Catastrophe🔥💔

Made a vicious spike collider that ruthlessly destroys any ball daring to fall on it—until I figure out how to make them burst into glorious, dramatic explosions. Also generated a maze script… which, uh, kinda exists but isn't exactly *mazey* yet. Work in progress. 😅

## 📚 Technical Concepts & Fun Tips

## Technical Concepts & Fun Tips 🛠️✨
| Week | Concept | Explanation | Fun Tip |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Week 1** | OpenGL vs. DirectX | Graphics APIs; OpenGL is cross-platform, DirectX is Windows-focused. | Choose wisely, like picking your Pokémon starter! |
| | CPU vs. GPU | CPU handles logic, GPU handles rendering. | GPUs = artists, CPUs = managers. |
| | 2D vs. 3D | 2D = points on a plane, 3D = axes and depth. | 2D: Simpler but less immersive; 3D: Welcome to the Matrix. |
| **Week 2** | Material Application | Drag & drop textures onto objects or assign via Mesh Renderer. | Lazy devs love drag-and-drop! |
| | Light Pollution Control | Avoid over-lighting; use intensity & range wisely. | If you feel blinded, so will your players. |
| **Week 3** | Rigidbody | Enables Unity physics; responds to gravity, forces, collisions. | Feels like bringing a rock to life. |
| | Gravity Control | Customizable in Rigidbody settings. | Zero gravity? Floating chaos unlocked! |
| | OnCollision vs. OnTrigger | OnCollision includes physics response; OnTrigger is for logic. | Triggers = invisible switches! |
| **Week 4** | Character Controller | A specialized component for player movement. | Avoids reinventing the wheel for movement. |
| | SimpleMove vs. Move | SimpleMove includes time factor; Move doesn’t. | One does the math for you, one lets you suffer. |
| | Jumping Physics | Uses velocity + gravity for realistic movement. | Apply force upwards, let gravity do the rest. |
| | Heightmaps | Convert real-world elevation into Unity terrains. | Want to game in your backyard? Import its heightmap! |

## Debug Table 🐞🔍
| Bug | Observation | Solution | Funny Comment |
|------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Local vs Global confusion in rotations | Switch between modes with toolbar; always check if rotation happens relative to parent or world. | Always verify rotation frame of reference. | Unity gaslighting me into thinking I rotated wrong. |
| Overwhelmed by Unity panels | Too many buttons, too many views. | Took deep breaths and focused on one panel at a time. | "Where am I? What year is it?" |
| Static spheres not rolling | Two spheres sitting awkwardly on each other — zero rolling, 100% awkwardness. | Added colliders, adjusted rigid body parameters. | They're just shy. Let them roll into friendship! |
| Creepy character snapping | Character face suddenly flips toward camera — terrifying horror movie moment. | Used LookAt with normalized vector and world rotation settings. | Instant Exorcist mode: activated. |
| Sudden object tunneling | Falling spheres going through the plane, physics ignored. | Switched collision detection to Continuous, added interpolation. | When gravity says "goodbye" mid-fall. |
| Diagonal speed boost | Moving diagonally made the object run faster than Sonic. | Normalized input vector magnitude. | Mario Kart drift unlocked by accident. |
| Trigger confusion | Didn’t know which object the other was referring to in OnTriggerEnter(). | Clarified reference: slime = trigger holder; "other" = object entering zone. | "Other" was the friend we made along the way. |
| Infinite Jumping | Player could jump infinitely like Flappy Bird. | Added grounded check before allowing jumps. | Accidental infinite jetpack mode unlocked! |
| Ramp Gravity Snapping | Falling from a ramp caused unnatural snapping effect. | Adjusted gravity calculations and ensured smooth velocity transition. | When Unity physics takes "teleportation" a bit too seriously. |
| Rigidbody not falling | Object ignored gravity and stayed in place. | Added a Rigidbody component and Collider. Character Controller replaces both. | Gravity who? |
| Object stuck, not moving | Repetitive movement logic caused conflicts. | Removed redundant commands and used only SimpleMove(). | "Pick one movement method, Unity said." |
| Game froze | Used `Time.deltaTime` instead of `Time.fixedDeltaTime`. | Fixed by replacing with `Time.deltaTime`. | Physics engine: "PAUSE!" |

7th quiz - THE REAL TEST!🚀

A magical sphere must climb a dangerous mountain to reach the Summit Portal, a mysterious 
gateway at the peak. But the journey is not easy, as huge rocks fall from above, threatening to break its 
protective blue shield. 
To survive, the sphere must dodge falling rocks while collecting blue shards, which restore lost parts 
of its shield. Every hit from a rock weakens the shield, making the climb even riskier. 
As the sphere ascends, the mountain becomes more dangerous. Reaching the summit will take skill, 
quick reflexes, and smart use of the shards. 
Can the sphere overcome the mountain’s challenges and complete its journey ?

MOVEMENT - 
- No Flappy Bird Jumping: The jump is now restricted to grounded states only. Once the player jumps, they cannot jump again until they hit the ground.

-  Movement via Torque: The movement uses torque instead of linear forces, simulating a natural rolling effect.

- Grounded Check: The isGrounded check ensures that jumping only happens when the player is actually touching the ground, preventing infinite jumps.

🎛️ System Configuration
- Randomized Particle Size & Position (X/Z slight, Y: 1–2) – For natural drop variation while keeping realistic proportions.

- Emission Rate: 200/sec – Balanced particle density for consistent rainfall without frame loss.

- Shape Scale: X: 20, Y: 0–20, Z: 20 – Wide spread to simulate a full-rainfield atmosphere.

- Velocity Over Lifetime (Y: -25 to -35) – Adds realistic fall speed and acceleration variation.

- Collision Enabled – Ensures raindrops interact with environment (terrain, objects).

- Renderer: Stretched Billboard – Elongates drops vertically to visually resemble falling rain.

- Damping: 1 | Bounce: 0.1 – Particles stop cleanly but with slight rebound to mimic splash effect.

- Lifetime Loss: 0.4 – Particles disappear shortly after impact to reduce GPU strain.

- Increased Drop Height (Y axis) – Gives particles more time to fall and simulate sky-origin rainfall.

✅ Reality Checks
- Meteorologically accurate drizzle design

- Studio-level frame-rate saver

- Full environmental integration achieved

- Gravity simulation without rigid bodies

- Immersion unlocked – not just visuals, but behavior

- Industry go-to for believable weather effects

- Precision-level surface interaction

- Budget-conscious lifecycle tuning

- Sky-to-ground realism activated

I didn’t just make particles— I engineered weather 🌧️🛠️
